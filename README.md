ipa_converter
=========

A simple python tool to convert IPA notation to ASCII.
Currently only produces SAMPA.

Robustness
=========
This tool IS NOT robust.
It was built on a single linux system without careful consideration for issues with encoding.
I would greatly appreciate any efforts to make a version of this which is platform independent.

I believe it may serve as a useful starting point for others tying to convert between IPA and its ASCII encodings.
